# Introduction to Cyber

Cybersecurity is an ever-growing and ever-evolving field. With today’s constant fast-paced increase in new industrial products and infrastructures comes an equally increasing potential amount of cyberattacks. This lesson introduces the field of cybersecurity and related terminology.

## `What is Information Security?`

### Information Security Vs. Cybersecurity

> Cyber is a broad term often used when discussing both computing and networking.
> The beginning of the internet was not about the security but about the way to connect.

#### Information Security

Information security is a field based on techniques that safeguard data stored in computers or transmitted among them against unauthorized access and misuse.

#### Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a field that involves protecting computer systems and networks against cyberthreats using both computer-based and physical means.

- Cybersecurity experts are often divided into two groups:
  - Blue Team, which operates in a defensive role
  - Red Team, which operates in an offensive role

### Impact of Information Security

#### Technological Impact

Nowadays, we heavily rely on technology since it plays an important role in our daily lives. Technology can be found in water purification facilities, airports, autonomous vehicles, drones, and more. Each device or facility that implements technology requires strong security measures to prevent its systems from being hacked.

> Cybersecurity is needed everywhere. Every technological device requires protection.

### Principles of Information Security

#### Confidentiality
Confidentiality, also referred to as privacy, is the first principle of information security. It calls for secure storage and transmission of information. Confidentiality also deals with proper data classification and management.

#### Integrity
Integrity typically deals with verifying the consistency of the data that passes from one computer system to another. Unauthorized third-parties should not be able to modify it.

#### Availability
Data and resources need to be available. Availability is maintained using different methods, such as hardware maintenance, software patching, and network optimization. Backups and dedicated hardware can also ensure that various types of attacks or malfunctions do not affect it.
